Them little breaky shits off an Ikea `Vilmar` chair. NB all 4 need to be replaced or you are doomed to sit askew

Crap related to `Central Machinery 5 Speed Bench Drill Press`:
- `DepthGaugeBracket`: It holds the depth limiter and maybe braces the chuck against lateral movement. It is not available as a replacement part and is easily broken.
